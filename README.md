# Autoencoder MLP with PyTorch and MNIST

This repository contains a simple implementation of an autoencoder with a 4-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset for image reconstruction and denoising tasks.

## Usage

### Running the Code

To perform a  test, run the following command:

```
python test.py
```

First You will be prompted to enter an image index for testing, then you will be prompted to enter an image index for testing denoising, finnaly you will be prompted to enter two image indices for interpolation testing.
